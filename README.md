# ERC677 for Solidity 0.7.x

**Please read the Notice section in this document.**

ERC677 is a proposed standard that enables logic on the receiving contract to handle incoming token transactions. It inherits ERC20, allowing backward compatibility safely.

This implementation uses Solidity 0.7.x.

ERC20 implementation is from [OpenZeppelin v3.3](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/release-v3.3).
